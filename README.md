Ronan McCabe
======================

I am a Full-Stack Node.js Web Developer, with a background in logistics and warehouse management, and a graduate of the highly selective [Founders & Coders](http://www.foundersandcoders.com/) bootcamp.

Code Examples

My personal website with some JavaScript web apps. Key technologies used are client-side JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, error handling, high test coverage and cookie-based analytics. There is also an analytics page built in Angular.js that displays all visitor statistics.

This is a possibly overambitious Instagram clone that is still a work in progress, and uses image upload to Amazon Web Services, Google Authentication based user profiles and Redis database for storing image metadata.

I love writing clean, well-structured and tested code, and especially enjoy working with new technologies and frameworks.

About Me
--------------------

I am 27 years old, and from Ireland. After a lifelong interest in tech and computers, I started coding about a year ago. I quickly became infatuated with it and knew I needed to do it for a living. My original plan was to leave Melbourne, Australia where I was living and return to Ireland to build a portfolio in Java, but I heard about Founders & Coders and my plans took a turn towards London, and JavaScript.

In my spare time I enjoy cooking and keeping fit and past/current hobbies include snowboarding, cycling, performing stand-up comedy and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
